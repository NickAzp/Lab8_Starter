1.
Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed.
This automation allows for continuous integration that ensures that the standard is always being followed

No, an end to end test would not be ideal since the purpose of an end to end test is test the application from start to finish.


3.
A unit test would not be suitable for this. Since a unit test is to test for independent systems like the output of a function, it would not work for encompassing an entire message feature. This would be better suited for an end to end test.


4.
Yes, a unit test would be good for testing the max message length. Since this can be suited to a single function with a single purpose, it would be very easy to write a unit test for it that ensures a message does not go above 80 characters.
